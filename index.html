<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em> HTML documents form the majority of the
  content on the web. <em>HTML 5</em> is the current version we are using on the web.
</p>

<b>HTML Tags</b>
<p>Tags tell the browser how the HTML document should look and contain. </p>
<b>HTML Characterics</b> 
<p>1. There are two types: <em> Inline</em> and <em>Block.</em> <b>Inline</b> means it the text stays on the same line, while <strong>Block</strong> places an invisble box around the content.<br>2. HTML tags can be nested: This means you can have more than one tag inside another tag. <br>3. HTML tags can also have attributes: This is a property of the HTML tag. 
  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444">This video</a>
  explains the distinction well.
</p>

<b>Example of HTML Tags</b>
<p> <b>All</b> HTML tags have to be contained between "<"opening tag and closing tag "/>" <b> There are exceptions</b> Some tag are call <em> Void</em> tags and they do not need a closing tag. <span><br>"b" = bold <br>"em" = italics <br>"br" = break <br>"a" = anchor (used for links) </br></span>
</p>

<b>Always Remember</b>
<p>Computers are stupid and you must pay attention to detail. <b> Misspelled</b> words; unclosed tags; and missed puncutation cn cause your page to break or cause it to be unreadable.
